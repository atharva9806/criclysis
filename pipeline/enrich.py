"""Resolve bowling styles and batting hands for the players in the corpus.

Cricsheet ball-by-ball data names the bowler but never says what kind of bowler
they are, and that single attribute is the hinge the whole matchup analysis
turns on. This module fills it in, from cheapest source to most expensive:

1. ``data/styles.csv`` in the repo - a curated file, always consulted first,
   and the place to put corrections. It is authoritative: nothing overwrites it.
2. ``--styles-file`` - your own CSV (a licensed feed, a club database).
3. ``--enrich espncricinfo`` - one profile request per unresolved player,
   joined via the Cricsheet register's ``key_cricinfo`` column. Opt-in,
   robots-gated, rate-limited and cached.

Whatever is still unresolved simply stays blank: those deliveries drop out of
the bowling-type splits and are reported in the build summary, rather than
being guessed at.
