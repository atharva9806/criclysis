"""Build a fictional demo dataset, for tests only.

Simulates a fictional international cricket world, then runs it through exactly
the same aggregator, analyser and exporter that real Cricsheet data goes
through. The manifest marks the result ``dataset: "demo"``, and the importer
refuses to load it: nothing here may ever be presented as real. It exists so
the tests can exercise the whole build, end to end, without downloads, and so
the analysis engine can be checked against planted, known answers.
